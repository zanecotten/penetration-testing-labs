# 🛡️ Penetration Testing Lab & CTF Writeups

This repository contains my collection of penetration testing labs and Capture the Flag (CTF) writeups.  
These notes document my process for practicing real-world attack techniques, sharpening methodology, and preparing for certifications such as **eJPT**, **OSCP**, and beyond.

## 🛠️ Methodology

Each writeup generally follows this structure:

1. **Recon** → Initial scanning and enumeration (`nmap`, `gobuster`, etc.)  
2. **Enumeration** → Digging deeper into services, versions, and misconfigurations  
3. **Exploitation** → Gaining access using exploits, misconfigs, or credentials  
4. **Privilege Escalation** → Techniques used to obtain higher-level access  
5. **Proof** → Capturing the flag / verifying access (flag redacted in public writeups)  
6. **Lessons Learned** → Key takeaways for future reference

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These writeups are for **educational purposes only**.  
- Flags, credentials, and sensitive information are **sanitized** or **redacted**.  
- HackTheBox and TryHackMe writeups are only for **retired/approved labs** in line with their rules.
